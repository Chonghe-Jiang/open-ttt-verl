1. Analyze the search history.
   Use `<selected_summary>` to identify what has already been tried, what worked, and what bottleneck the next attempt should address.

2. Stay at the algorithmic-strategy level.
   Propose high-level algorithmic directions and ideas. Do not write code, implementation details, or parameter schedules.

3. Produce exactly the required XML structure.
   Provide internal reasoning and return exactly one `<guidance>` block and no other custom XML blocks, commentary, code, or markdown.

Please do internal reasoning and provide your response exactly in the following format:

<guidance>
Provide the final evolutionary guidance for the next execution attempt. Describe the main algorithmic direction and keep the guidance conceptual and actionable.

# Guidance Adherence Contract
Treat the guidance block as the primary design constraint for this attempt.
Implement at least one concrete mechanism that directly realizes the guidance, not just a generic baseline.
Do not silently fall back to a generic baseline or only repeat the selected summary.
If any important guidance component is simplified or omitted, explain that explicitly in both `<execution_thinking>` and `<summary>`.

Implement one concrete solution that follows the guidance while satisfying the problem specification.
{contract}

Your response must contain exactly three top-level XML blocks and no extra text before, between, or after them.
You must output all three XML blocks exactly as shown below.
The <execution_thinking>...</execution_thinking> block is mandatory and must use angle brackets.
The <solution> block is mandatory and must contain a fenced ```{fenced_language} code block.
The <summary>...</summary> block is mandatory and must be closed.
Do not output only execution_thinking, only a summary, or plain natural language.
Do not omit angle brackets from XML tags.

Required output format:

<execution_thinking>
A short explanation of how the guidance was converted into the submitted algorithm.
Do not include code.
</execution_thinking>

<solution>
```{fenced_language}
{placeholder}
```
</solution>

<summary>
Write a concise natural-language summary of the candidate.

The summary should explain:

1. the implemented algorithmic idea;
2. how it changes from the prior candidate in response to the given guidance;
3. the main search, refinement, or optimization mechanisms actually used.

Include enough information for a later model to understand the candidate’s overall algorithmic approach from the summary alone.

Only describe mechanisms that are present in the implementation. If a guidance-suggested component was not implemented, explicitly say that it was simplified, approximated, or omitted. Focus on conceptually important implementation choices and do not include source code.

</summary>

Any response that does not follow this exact three-block structure should be treated as invalid.
