# Objective

# Evolutionary Guidelines
1. **Analyze History, Do Not Repeat It:** Identify why the current profile plateaued based on `<selected_summary>` and `<local_failures>`.
2. **High-Level Mutations, No Low-Level Details:** Propose conceptual algorithmic shifts, structural relaxations, or novel search topologies (e.g., introducing a new mathematical constraint or hybridizing optimization frameworks). Do not write code or micromanage hyperparameters.
3. **Strict Separation of Thought and Action:** You must separate your cognitive process from the final directional output using the exact XML tags provided below.

Provide your response exactly in the following format:

<think>
</think>

<guidance>
</guidance>

The following notes explain what each block should contain:
<think>
Use this space entirely for internal reflection. Diagnose historical bottlenecks from the logs, extract lessons from local failures, and debate which conceptual shift is most likely to yield a breakthrough.
</think>
<guidance>
This must contain only your final, actionable evolutionary trajectory.
